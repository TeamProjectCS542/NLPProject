# Thomson Reuters Auto-Generating News Articles based on Anomalies in Financial Series Data
In this project, we build a model that can detect newsworthy anomalies from stock price data and auto-generate human acceptable captions describing them. In particular, we choose to focus on five companies: Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, and General Electric.
The project is divided into two parts, anomaly detection and caption generation.
